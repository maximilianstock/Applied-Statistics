# Where Do People Drink The Most Beer, Wine And Spirits?

Back in 2014, [fivethiryeight.com](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/dear-mona-followup-where-do-people-drink-the-most-beer-wine-and-spirits/) published an article on alchohol consumption in different countries. The data `drinks` is available as part of the `fivethirtyeight` package. Make sure you have installed the `fivethirtyeight` package before proceeding.

```{r load_alcohol_data, warning = FALSE}
library(fivethirtyeight)
data(drinks)


# or download directly
alcohol_direct <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/alcohol-consumption/drinks.csv")

```

-   What are the variable types? Any missing values we should worry about?

```{r glimpse_skim_data, warning = FALSE}
skim(alcohol_direct)
```

*As the report on `n_missing` in the above output shows, there don't seem to be any missing values for any variable in the data set. Moreover, we can observe that the only non-numeric variable is `country`, while the four remaining are numeric.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Make a plot that shows the top 25 beer consuming countries

```{r beer_plot, warning = FALSE}
# YOUR CODE GOES HERE
beer_consumtion <- alcohol_direct %>%
  slice_max(order_by = beer_servings, n = 25)

ggplot(beer_consumtion, aes(y=fct_reorder(country,beer_servings), x=beer_servings))+
  geom_col(fill = "orange")+
  theme_bw(  )+
  labs(title = "Beer Consumption", subtitle = "The top beer consuming countries", x="Annual Servings", y="Country")

```

Make a plot that shows the top 25 wine consuming countries

```{r wine_plot, warning = FALSE}

wine_consumption <- alcohol_direct %>%
  slice_max(order_by = wine_servings, n = 25)

ggplot(wine_consumption, aes(y=fct_reorder(country,wine_servings), x=wine_servings))+
  geom_col(fill = "darkred")+
  theme_bw(  )+
  labs(title = "Wine Consumption", subtitle = "The top wine consuming countries", x="Annual Servings", y="Country")


```

Finally, make a plot that shows the top 25 spirit consuming countries

```{r spirit_plot, warning = FALSE}
# YOUR CODE GOES HERE
spirit_consumtion <- alcohol_direct %>%
  slice_max(order_by = spirit_servings, n = 25)

ggplot(spirit_consumtion, aes(y=fct_reorder(country,spirit_servings), x=spirit_servings))+
  geom_col(fill = "lightblue")+
  theme_bw(  )+
  labs(title = "Spirit Consumption", subtitle = "The top spirit consuming countries", x="Annual Servings", y="Country")


```

-   What can you infer from these plots? Don't just explain what's in the graph, but speculate or tell a short story (1-2 paragraphs max).

*In general, there tends to be no overlap among countries with regards to the top spots in alcohol consumption, i.e. the top beer consuming countries are not the top wine consuming countries. It is surprising that Germany is only ranked \#4 in the top beer consuming countries, after Namibia, Czech Republic and Gabon. A quick research on the reason for Namibia's high beer consumption hint at its former colonial ties with Germany (see [here](https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/beer-consumption-by-country). Also, one can observe that the top wine consuming countries are almost exclusively European, which might be due to the reason that wine is culturally rooted in these countries and many of them are also known for their production of wine.*

# Analysis of movies- IMDB dataset

We will look at a subset sample of movies, taken from the [Kaggle IMDB 5000 movie dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/carolzhangdc/imdb-5000-movie-dataset)

```{r load_movies, warning = FALSE}

movies <- read_csv(here::here("data", "movies.csv"))
glimpse(movies)

```

Besides the obvious variables of `title`, `genre`, `director`, `year`, and `duration`, the rest of the variables are as follows:

-   `gross` : The gross earnings in the US box office, not adjusted for inflation
-   `budget`: The movie's budget
-   `cast_facebook_likes`: the number of facebook likes cast memebrs received
-   `votes`: the number of people who voted for (or rated) the movie in IMDB
-   `reviews`: the number of reviews for that movie
-   `rating`: IMDB average rating

-   Are there any missing values (NAs)? Are all entries distinct or are there duplicate entries?

```{r missing_values, warning = FALSE}
skim(movies)
```

*There are no missing values as can be observed when analysing `n_missing`, however, there are duplicate values for some variables. What is especially interesting, is that there are duplicate Titles for movies. This can be observed through looking at `n_unique`: Even though there are a total of 2961 records, there only seem to be 2907 unique movie titles.*

***

-   Produce a table with the count of movies by genre, ranked in descending order

```{r count2, warning = FALSE}
count_moviesByGenre<-movies%>%
  group_by(genre)%>%
  count(sort=TRUE)%>%
  rename("number_of_movies" = n)

count_moviesByGenre
```

*There seems to be quite a large difference in the number of records across genres in this dataset, as there is information on 848 Comedy movies opposed to only 1 on Thrillers.*

***

-   Produce a table with the average gross earning and budget (`gross` and `budget`) by genre. Calculate a variable `return_on_budget` which shows how many \$ did a movie make at the box office for each \$ of its budget. Rank genres by this `return_on_budget` in descending order.

```{r avg_gross_earning, warning = FALSE}
avgGenre <- movies%>%
  group_by(genre)%>%
  summarise(mean(gross), mean(budget))%>%
  
  rename("Average_Gross" = "mean(gross)", "Average_Budget" = "mean(budget)")%>%
  
  mutate(return_on_budget = Average_Gross/Average_Budget)%>%
  
  mutate(Average_Gross = dollar(Average_Gross), Average_Budget = dollar(Average_Budget))%>% # The dollar function is from the scales package and allows us to make the numbers more easily readable.
  mutate(return_on_budget = round(return_on_budget, 3))%>% #We round the return column to the 3rd nearest decimal.
  
  arrange(desc(return_on_budget))

avgGenre
```

***

-   Produce a table that shows the top 15 directors who have created the highest gross revenue in the box office. Don't just show the total gross amount, but also the mean, median, and standard deviation per director.

```{r topDirectors, warning = FALSE}
topDirectors <- movies%>%
  group_by(director)%>%
  summarise(total_gross = sum(gross), avg_gross = mean(gross), median_gross = median(gross), sd_gross = sd(gross))%>%
  slice_max(order_by = total_gross, n = 15)%>%
  
  mutate(total_gross = dollar(total_gross), avg_gross = dollar(avg_gross), median_gross = dollar(median_gross), sd_gross = dollar(sd_gross))

topDirectors
```

***

-   Finally, ratings. Produce a table that describes how ratings are distributed by genre. We don't want just the mean, but also, min, max, median, SD and some kind of a histogram or density graph that visually shows how ratings are distributed.

```{r hist_ratings, warning = FALSE}
ratings <- movies%>%
  group_by(genre)%>%
  summarise(avg_rating = mean(rating), min_rating = min(rating), max_rating = max(rating), median_rating = median(rating), sd_rating = sd(rating))%>%
  arrange(desc(avg_rating))
ratings

overall<-ggplot(movies, aes(x=rating))+
  geom_histogram(color="black", fill="white")+
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept=mean(rating), color = "Average Rating"), linetype = "dashed")+
  labs(title = "Rating distribution", subtitle = "A histogram on overall rating across genres", x = "Rating")+
  scale_color_manual(name = "Legend", values = c("Average Rating" = "orange"))+ #We adjust the legend to display the proper label for the mean line
  theme_bw()
overall

rating_by_genre<-ggplot(movies, aes(x=rating))+
  geom_histogram(color="black", fill="white")+
  facet_wrap(vars(genre), scales = "free_y")+ #we decided that it would be more visually informative, if the y axis adapts from histogram to histogram.
  labs(title = "Rating distribution", subtitle = "Histograms per genre")+
  theme_bw()
rating_by_genre
```

***

-   Examine the relationship between `gross` and `cast_facebook_likes`. Produce a scatterplot and write one sentence discussing whether the number of facebook likes that the cast has received is likely to be a good predictor of how much money a movie will make at the box office. What variable are you going to map to the Y- and X- axes?

```{r gross_on_fblikes, warning = FALSE}
all_scatter_likes <- ggplot(movies, aes(x=cast_facebook_likes, y=gross))+
  geom_point(aes(color=genre))+
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")+
  
  scale_x_continuous(labels = number)+ #we use the scales package to enhance the axes' readability 
  scale_y_continuous(labels = dollar)+
  
  labs(title = "Likes and gross revenue", subtitle = "An undadjusted look at the relationship between casts' facebook popularity and the movie's gross revenue", x = "Casts' likes on facebook", y = "Gross Revenue")+
  theme_bw()

all_scatter_likes


#In the following, we left out the visualization of outlying values in order to make the graph easier to read.
adjusted_scatter_likes <- ggplot(movies,aes(x=cast_facebook_likes, y=gross))+

  geom_point(aes(color=genre))+
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")+

  xlim(0, 150000)+ #we limit the display of values on the x and y axes. This does not exclude the values from the regression line calculation, but only enhances readability.
  ylim(0,500000000)+
  
  labs(title = "Likes and gross revenue", subtitle = "An adjusted look at the relationship between casts' facebook popularity and the movie's gross revenue", x = "Casts' likes on facebook", y = "Gross Revenue")+
  theme_bw()

adjusted_scatter_likes
```

*From the trendline and correlation coefficient of 0.28 one can observe that there is a weak positive correlation between the two variables indicating that the casts' Facebook popularity may help predict the gross revenue of a movie to a slight extent.*

***

-   Examine the relationship between `gross` and `budget`. Produce a scatterplot and write one sentence discussing whether budget is likely to be a good predictor of how much money a movie will make at the box office.

```{r gross_on_budget, warning = FALSE}
all_scatter_budget <- ggplot(movies, aes(x=budget, y=gross))+
  geom_point(aes(color=genre))+
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")+
  
  scale_x_continuous(labels = dollar)+
  scale_y_continuous(labels = dollar)+

  labs(title = "Budget and gross revenue", subtitle = "A look at the relationship between the movie's budget and its gross revenue", x = "Budget", y = "Gross Revenue")+

  theme_bw()
all_scatter_budget

```

*Compared to the casts' facebook popularity, budget seems to be a stronger predictor of a movie's gross revenue as the correlation coefficient is closer to 1.*

***

-   Examine the relationship between `gross` and `rating`. Produce a scatterplot, faceted by `genre` and discuss whether IMDB ratings are likely to be a good predictor of how much money a movie will make at the box office. Is there anything strange in this dataset?

```{r gross_on_rating, warning = FALSE}
all_scatter_rating <- ggplot(movies, aes(x=rating, y=gross))+
  geom_point(aes(color=genre), size=0.5)+
  ylim(0,750000000)+
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")+
  facet_wrap(vars(genre), scales = "free_y")+ #we decide to only have a changing y axis across the charts to make identifying smaller values easier 
  
  scale_y_continuous(labels = dollar_format(scale = 1/10000000, prefix = "m $"))+ #we use the scales package to scale the y axis to million $
  
  labs(title = "Rating and gross revenue", subtitle = "A look at the relationship between a movie's rating and its gross revenue", x = "Rating", y = "Gross Revenue")+
  
  theme_bw()

all_scatter_rating

```

*Overall, one can observe a positive correlation between a movie's rating and its gross revenue, however, as with casts' facebook likes, the correlation is weak. Due to the small sample size of some genres (e.g. Musical, Western and Sci-Fi), not all trendlines are representative.*

# Returns of financial stocks


```{r load_nyse_data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, warning = FALSE}
nyse <- read_csv(here::here("data","nyse.csv"))
```

- Based on this dataset, create a table and a bar plot that shows the number of companies per sector, in descending order

```{r companies_per_sector, warning = FALSE}

# YOUR CODE GOES HERE
sector_df<-nyse%>%
  group_by(sector)%>%
  summarise(number = count(sector))%>%
  arrange(desc(number))
sector_df
  
barplot_sector<- ggplot(sector, aes(y=fct_reorder(sector, number), x=number))+
  geom_col(fill = "darkblue", width = 0.5)+
  geom_text(aes(label = number), hjust = 3, color = "white")+ #we display the # of companies and use hjust to move the labels to the left.
  labs(title = "Sector differences", subtitle = "The number of companies per sector", y = "Sector", x= "Number of companies")+
  
  theme_bw()

barplot_sector
```

***

- Next, let's choose some stocks and their ticker symbols and download some data. You **MUST** choose 6 different stocks from the ones listed below; You should, however, add `SPY` which is the SP500 ETF (Exchange Traded Fund).

```{r get_price_data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
# Notice the cache=TRUE argument in the chunk options. Because getting data is time consuming, 
# cache=TRUE means that once it downloads data, the chunk will not run again next time you knit your Rmd

myStocks <- c("GREK","GME","AMC","AAPL","COW","TSLA","SPY" ) %>%
  tq_get(get  = "stock.prices",
         from = "2011-01-01",
         to   = "2021-08-31") %>%
  group_by(symbol) 

glimpse(myStocks) # examine the structure of the resulting data frame
```

***

```{r calculate_returns, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
#calculate daily returns
myStocks_returns_daily <- myStocks %>%
  tq_transmute(select     = adjusted, 
               mutate_fun = periodReturn, 
               period     = "daily", 
               type       = "log",
               col_rename = "daily_returns",
               cols = c(nested.col))  

#calculate monthly  returns
myStocks_returns_monthly <- myStocks %>%
  tq_transmute(select     = adjusted, 
               mutate_fun = periodReturn, 
               period     = "monthly", 
               type       = "arithmetic",
               col_rename = "monthly_returns",
               cols = c(nested.col)) 

#calculate yearly returns
myStocks_returns_annual <- myStocks %>%
  group_by(symbol) %>%
  tq_transmute(select     = adjusted, 
               mutate_fun = periodReturn, 
               period     = "yearly", 
               type       = "arithmetic",
               col_rename = "yearly_returns",
               cols = c(nested.col))
```

- Create a table where you summarise monthly returns for each of the stocks and `SPY`; min, max, median, mean, SD.

```{r summarise_monthly_returns, warning = FALSE}

# YOUR CODE GOES HERE
summary_monthly<-myStocks_returns_monthly%>%
  group_by(symbol)%>%
  summarise(min_return = min(monthly_returns), max_return = max(monthly_returns), median_return = median(monthly_returns), avg_return = mean(monthly_returns), sd_return = sd(monthly_returns))
summary_monthly
```

***

- Plot a density plot, using `geom_density()`, for each of the stocks

```{r density_monthly_returns, warning = FALSE}

# YOUR CODE GOES HERE
density<-ggplot(myStocks_returns_monthly, aes(x=monthly_returns))+
  geom_density()+
  facet_wrap(vars(symbol), scales="free")+ #we use free scales per density plot in order to enhance readability.
  
  labs(title = "Return Distribution", subtitle = "Density plots on monthly returns", x = "Monthly return", y = "Percentage")

density
```

- What can you infer from this plot? Which stock is the riskiest? The least risky?

*From the density plots, one can observe that volatility in monthly return varies widely across the stocks/ETF. For instance, the returns of COW seem to be more evenly distributed than GME, indicating a lower risk when investing into them. In our eyes, GME seems to be the riskiest stock, while an investment into GREK carries the least risk. The latter is understandable as the GREK ETF is diversified and holds shares of the largest and most liquid companies in Greece ([source](https://www.globalxetfs.com/funds/grek/)).*

*Looking at the x axis, one can also observe a large difference in the range of monthly returns across the instruments. Interestingly, most of the distribution lies around the 0 mark for all displayed tickers.*

***

- Finally, make a plot that shows the expected monthly return (mean) of a stock on the Y axis and the risk (standard deviation) in the X-axis. Please use `ggrepel::geom_text_repel()` to label each stock

```{r risk_return_plot, warning = FALSE}
# YOUR CODE GOES HERE
scatter_return_volatility <- ggplot(summary_monthly, aes(x=sd_return, y=avg_return, label=symbol))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = F)+ #in this case, we do not want a confidence interval around the regression line
  geom_text_repel()+
  
  labs(title = "Risk vs. Reward", subtitle = "A look at the relationship between the instruments' standard deviation and average monthly return", x = "Standard deviation", y = "Average monthly return")+
  
  theme_bw()

scatter_return_volatility
  
```

- What can you infer from this plot? Are there any stocks which, while being riskier, do not have a higher expected return?

*Generally, the market seems to reward higher risk with higher return. However, there are minor exceptions in our sample: GREK, indexing the Greek market, has a higher SD than SPY, yet its average monthly return is lower. A good approximation for comparing risk and reward across instruments is the blue linear regression line. Tickers above this line indicate a greater reward for a given risk compared to tickers below that line*

# On your own: IBM HR Analytics

For this task, you will analyse a data set on Human Resoruce Analytics. The [IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance data set](https://www.kaggle.com/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset) is a fictional data set created by IBM data scientists. Among other things, the data set includes employees' income, their distance from work, their position in the company, their level of education, etc. A full description can be found on the website.

First let us load the data

```{r load hrData, warning = FALSE}

hr_dataset <- read_csv(here::here("data", "datasets_1067_1925_WA_Fn-UseC_-HR-Employee-Attrition.csv"))
glimpse(hr_dataset)

```

I am going to clean the data set, as variable names are in capital letters, some variables are not really necessary, and some variables, e.g., `education` are given as a number rather than a more useful description

```{r cleanHRData, warning = FALSE}

hr_cleaned <- hr_dataset %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(
    education = case_when(
      education == 1 ~ "Below College",
      education == 2 ~ "College",
      education == 3 ~ "Bachelor",
      education == 4 ~ "Master",
      education == 5 ~ "Doctor"
    ),
    environment_satisfaction = case_when(
      environment_satisfaction == 1 ~ "Low",
      environment_satisfaction == 2 ~ "Medium",
      environment_satisfaction == 3 ~ "High",
      environment_satisfaction == 4 ~ "Very High"
    ),
    job_satisfaction = case_when(
      job_satisfaction == 1 ~ "Low",
      job_satisfaction == 2 ~ "Medium",
      job_satisfaction == 3 ~ "High",
      job_satisfaction == 4 ~ "Very High"
    ),
    performance_rating = case_when(
      performance_rating == 1 ~ "Low",
      performance_rating == 2 ~ "Good",
      performance_rating == 3 ~ "Excellent",
      performance_rating == 4 ~ "Outstanding"
    ),
    work_life_balance = case_when(
      work_life_balance == 1 ~ "Bad",
      work_life_balance == 2 ~ "Good",
      work_life_balance == 3 ~ "Better",
      work_life_balance == 4 ~ "Best"
    )
  ) %>% 
  select(age, attrition, daily_rate, department,
         distance_from_home, education,
         gender, job_role,environment_satisfaction,
         job_satisfaction, marital_status,
         monthly_income, num_companies_worked, percent_salary_hike,
         performance_rating, total_working_years,
         work_life_balance, years_at_company,
         years_since_last_promotion)

```

Produce a one-page summary describing this dataset. Here is a non-exhaustive list of questions:

1.  How often do people leave the company (`attrition`)

```{r attrition, warning = FALSE}
numberz<-hr_cleaned%>%
  group_by(attrition)%>%
  summarize(part = count(attrition))%>%
  mutate(perc = part/sum(part))
  NULL
numberz
```

Looking at the sheer counts of YES and NO entries for the attrition coloumn, around 237 of all employees have left the company, while 1233 have been staying employed. This corresponds to around 16% of all recorded employees.

2.  How are `age`, `years_at_company`, `monthly_income` and `years_since_last_promotion` distributed? can you roughly guess which of these variables is closer to Normal just by looking at summary statistics?

```{r age_years_income_promotion, warning = FALSE}
n<-length(hr_cleaned$age) 
pic_data<-data.frame(cbind(c(hr_cleaned$age,hr_cleaned$monthly_income, 
                  hr_cleaned$years_since_last_promotion), 
                c(rep("age",n),rep("monthly_income",n),rep("years_since_last_promotion",n)))) 
colnames(pic_data)<-c("Num","Attribute") 
pic_data$Num<-as.integer(pic_data$Num) 
colnames(pic_data)<-c("Num","Attribute") 
distribution<-ggplot(pic_data,aes(x=Num))+ 
  geom_histogram()+ 
  facet_wrap(vars(Attribute),scale="free")+ 
  labs(x="",y="Frequency")+ 
  theme_bw() 
distribution 
```

3.  How are `job_satisfaction` and `work_life_balance` distributed? Don't just report counts, but express categories as % of total

```{r satis_wlb, warning = FALSE}
hr_satis <- hr_cleaned %>% 
  group_by(job_satisfaction) %>% 
  count(sort=TRUE) %>% 
  mutate(percent=n/1470) 
hr_satis 
work_life_satis <- hr_cleaned %>% 
  group_by(work_life_balance) %>% 
  count(sort=TRUE) %>% 
  mutate(percent=n/1470) 
 
work_life_satis 
```

4.  Is there any relationship between monthly income and education? Monthly income and gender?

```{r income_education, warning = FALSE}
plot1 <- ggplot(hr_cleaned, aes(y=monthly_income, x = education))+ 
  geom_boxplot() 
plot1 
  
plot2 <-ggplot(hr_cleaned, aes(y=monthly_income, x = gender))+ 
  geom_boxplot() 
plot2 
 
```

5.  Plot a boxplot of income vs job role. Make sure the highest-paid job roles appear first

```{r income_vs_job, warning = FALSE}
income_vs_job <- ggplot(hr_cleaned, aes(x=reorder(job_role, -monthly_income, na.rm = TRUE), y=monthly_income)) + 
  geom_boxplot()+
  labs(y="Monthly Income", x = "Job", title = "Income Distribution By Job")+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1))

  

income_vs_job

```

6.  Calculate and plot a bar chart of the mean (or median?) income by education level.

```{r bar_income_edu, warning = FALSE}

ggplo <- ggplot(hr_cleaned, aes(x=edu))

```

7.  Plot the distribution of income by education level. Use a facet_wrap and a theme from `ggthemes`

```{r dist_income_education, warning = FALSE}
plot7 <- hr_cleaned %>%  
  group_by(education) %>%  
  ggplot(aes(x=monthly_income))+ 
  geom_histogram()+ 
  ggthemes::theme_wsj() 
plot7 
```

8.  Plot income vs age, faceted by `job_role`

```{r income_age_job, warning = FALSE}
plot8 <- ggplot(hr_cleaned, aes(x=age, y=monthly_income))+ 
  geom_point(size=0.1)+ 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")+ 
  facet_wrap(vars(job_role), scales = "free" ) 
plot8 
```

# Challenge 1: Replicating a chart

The purpose of this exercise is to reproduce a plot using your `dplyr` and `ggplot2` skills. Read the article [The Racial Factor: There's 77 Counties Which Are Deep Blue But Also Low-Vaxx. Guess What They Have In Common?](https://acasignups.net/21/07/18/racial-factor-theres-77-counties-which-are-deep-blue-also-low-vaxx-guess-what-they-have) and have a look at the attached figure.

```{r challenge1, echo=FALSE, out.width="90%", warning = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "vaxxes_by_state_red_blue_every_county_070321_1.jpg"), error = FALSE)

You dont have to worry about the blue-red backgound and don't worry about replicating it exactly, try and see how far you can get. You're encouraged to work together if you want to and exchange tips/tricks you figured out-- and even though the figure in the original article is from early July 2021, you can use the most recent data.

Some hints to get you started:

1.  To get vaccination by county, we will use [data from the CDC](https://data.cdc.gov/Vaccinations/COVID-19-Vaccinations-in-the-United-States-County/8xkx-amqh)
2.  You need to get [County Presidential Election Returns 2000-2020](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/VOQCHQ)
3.  Finally, you also need an estimate of the [population of each county](https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/DataFiles/48747/PopulationEstimates.csv?v=2232)

```{r loadCountyData, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE, warning = FALSE}

# Download CDC vaccination by county
cdc_url <- "https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/8xkx-amqh/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD"
vaccinations <- vroom(cdc_url) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  filter(fips != "UNK") # remove counties that have an unknown (UNK) FIPS code

# Download County Presidential Election Returns
# https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/VOQCHQ
election2020_results <- vroom(here::here("data", "countypres_2000-2020.csv")) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  
  # just keep the results for the 2020 election
  filter(year == "2020") %>% 
  
  # change original name county_fips to fips, to be consistent with the other two files
  rename (fips = county_fips)

# Download county population data
population_url <- "https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/DataFiles/48747/PopulationEstimates.csv?v=2232"
population <- vroom(population_url) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  
  # select the latest data, namely 2019
  select(fips = fip_stxt, pop_estimate_2019) %>% 
  
  # pad FIPS codes with leading zeros, so they are always made up of 5 characters
  mutate(fips = stringi::stri_pad_left(fips, width=5, pad = "0"))

```

```{r}
skim(population)
```

```{r cleanCountryData, warning = FALSE}
#as there are multiple dates for vacc statuses, and we are only interested in the most recent one, we can do some cleaning. Data from Sep. 3rd, 2021, seems to be most recent.

vaccinations_recent <- vaccinations %>%
  filter(date=="09/03/2021")

#we can also include an additional coloumn to the election dataset, indicating the number of votes for one candidate as a percentage of whole

elections_perc <- election2020_results%>%
  mutate(perc_votes = candidatevotes/totalvotes)
```

```{r join_by_fips, warning = FALSE}
#We decide to just join coloumn series_complete_pop_pct from the vacc dataset, as this should suffice to recreate the graph. We also rename the coloumns to make their names a little more easy on the tongue.

joined_frame <- inner_join(population, vaccinations_recent[,c("fips", "series_complete_pop_pct") ], by = "fips")%>%
  rename("vacc_perc" = "series_complete_pop_pct", "pop" = "pop_estimate_2019")

#Similarly, we join parts of the cleaned election data, and filter out records other than votes for Trump, as they are not needed for the graph. In addtion, we sum up perc_votes because there is sometimes data for different ways of voting, i.e. early vote, election day, provisional.

joined_frame <- inner_join(joined_frame, elections_perc[,c("fips", "candidate", "perc_votes")])%>%
  filter(candidate=="DONALD J TRUMP")%>%
  group_by(fips, pop, vacc_perc, candidate, )%>%
  summarise(sum(perc_votes))%>%
  rename("perc_votes_total" = "sum(perc_votes)")

head(joined_frame) #we can have a look at the dataset. It looks like we have all the data we need for visualization
```

```{r visualize_election_vacc_pop, warning = FALSE}
plot_counties <- ggplot(joined_frame, aes(x=perc_votes_total, vacc_perc))+
  geom_rect(aes(xmin = 0, xmax = 0.45, ymin = 0, ymax = 100), fill = "#A6A8FB")+
  geom_rect(aes(xmin = 0.45, xmax = 0.55, ymin = 0, ymax = 100), fill = "#D2A6D2")+
  geom_rect(aes(xmin = 0.55, xmax = 1, ymin = 0, ymax = 100), fill = "#FDA7A7")+
  geom_point(aes(size=pop), alpha = 1/3)+
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")+
  theme_bw()
plot_counties

#It seems like there are a number of outliers in the dataset. 276 counties have reported a full vaccination count of 0 for the Sep. 3rd collection. As you can see in the output, Bexar county, home to a population of 2003554 reported a vacc rate of 0%.

filter(joined_frame, fips==48029)

#It might be appropriate, to exclude the records with vacc_perc = 0 from out dataset, as it seems very hard to believe that among 2003554 people, not a single one is fully vaccinated. An error like this potentially has a large impact on the regression line. We therefore create an adjusted DF.

adj_joined_fram <- joined_frame%>%
  filter(vacc_perc!=0)

adj_plot_counties <- ggplot(adj_joined_fram, aes(x = perc_votes_total, y = vacc_perc))+
  geom_rect(aes(xmin = 0, xmax = 0.45, ymin = 0, ymax = 100), fill = "#A6A8FB")+

# Challenge 2: Opinion polls for the 2021 German elections

The Guardian newspaper has an [election poll tracker for the upcoming German election](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/aug/20/german-election-poll-tracker-who-will-be-the-next-chancellor). The list of the opinion polls since Jan 2021 can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_2021_German_federal_election) and your task is to reproduce the graph similar to the one produced by the Guardian.

The following code will scrape the wikipedia page and import the table in a dataframe.

```{r, scrape_wikipedia_polling_data, warnings= FALSE, message=FALSE}
url <- "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_2021_German_federal_election"
# https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/who-will-succeed-angela-merkel
# https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/21/german-election-poll-tracker-who-will-be-the-next-chancellor


# get tables that exist on wikipedia page 
tables <- url %>% 
  read_html() %>% 
  html_nodes(css="table")


# parse HTML tables into a dataframe called polls 
# Use purr::map() to create a list of all tables in URL
polls <- map(tables, . %>% 
             html_table(fill=TRUE)%>% 
             janitor::clean_names())


# list of opinion polls
german_election_polls <- polls[[1]] %>% # the first table on the page contains the list of all opinions polls
  slice(2:(n()-1)) %>%  # drop the first row, as it contains again the variable names and last row that contains 2017 results
  mutate(
         # polls are shown to run from-to, e.g. 9-13 Aug 2021. We keep the last date, 13 Aug here, as the poll date
         # and we extract it by picking the last 11 characters from that field
         end_date = str_sub(fieldwork_date, -11),
         
         # end_date is still a string, so we convert it into a date object using lubridate::dmy()
         end_date = dmy(end_date),
         
         # we also get the month and week number from the date, if we want to do analysis by month- week, etc.
         month = month(end_date),
         week = isoweek(end_date)
         )
```

```{r visualize_german_election_polls, warning = FALSE, echo=FALSE,results='hide',fig.keep='all'}

plot_election_polls <- ggplot(german_election_polls, aes(x = end_date))+
  geom_point(aes(y = union), color = "black", alpha = 0.3)+ 
  geom_line(aes(y=rollmean(union, 14, na.pad=TRUE)), color = "black")+ #we add a line representing the rolling average of values for the past 14 days. We also adjust the padding for enhancing visualization.
  
  geom_point(aes(y = spd), color = "red", alpha = 0.3)+
  geom_line(aes(y=rollmean(spd, 14, na.pad=TRUE)), color = "red")+
  
  geom_point(aes(y = grune), color = "darkgreen", alpha = 0.3)+
  geom_line(aes(y=rollmean(grune, 14, na.pad=TRUE)), color = "darkgreen")+
  
  geom_point(aes(y = af_d), color = "blue", alpha = 0.3)+
  geom_line(aes(y=rollmean(af_d, 14, na.pad=TRUE)), color = "blue")+
  
  geom_point(aes(y = fdp), color = "#F4E332", alpha = 0.3)+
  geom_line(aes(y=rollmean(fdp, 14, na.pad=TRUE)), color = "#F4E332")+
  
  geom_point(aes(y=linke), color = "darkred", alpha = 0.3)+
  geom_line(aes(y=rollmean(linke, 14, na.pad = TRUE)), color = "darkred")+
  
  labs(x="2021 Poll Month", y="Voting Percentage", title = "German Elections", subtitle = "Change in estimated voting during 2021")

# Rubric

Check minus (1/5): Displays minimal effort. Doesn't complete all components. Code is poorly written and not documented. Uses the same type of plot for each graph, or doesn't use plots appropriate for the variables being analyzed.

Check (3/5): Solid effort. Hits all the elements. No clear mistakes. Easy to follow (both the code and the output).

Check plus (5/5): Finished all components of the assignment correctly and addressed both challenges. Code is well-documented (both self-documented and with additional comments as necessary). Used tidyverse, instead of base R. Graphs and tables are properly labelled. Analysis is clear and easy to follow, either because graphs are labeled clearly or you've written additional text to describe how you interpret the output.
